# tetheredspheredynamics
Hi! This summer, as a part of funded research I received through the University of Pennsylvania's Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program, I worked in the Aerodynamics, Wind, and Renewable Energy Lab under Dr. Wei. This project encapsulates the work I conducted on tethered sphere dynamics and environmental flows over the course of this summer.
