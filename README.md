# tetheredspheredynamics
Hi! This summer, as a part of funded research I received through the University of Pennsylvania's Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program, I worked in the Aerodynamics, Wind, and Renewable Energy Lab under Dr. Wei. This project encapsulates the work I conducted on tethered sphere dynamics and environmental flows over the course of this summer.

An important part of the field of environmental science and engineering is understanding the fluid mechanics behind environmental flows, specifically in the atmosphere, rivers, and oceans. Measuring these flows can be difficult, however, because of the large length scales they span; the motivation behind this project is to develop cost-effective flow sensors to provide flow maps with high accuracy. How our project specifically aims to do this is by utilizing the dynamics of tethered spheres by designing and 3D printing different roughness elements and protrusions of different sizes and types to vary on a sphere, increasing the roughness on a sphere and encouraging the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent. This experiment is a step forward towards developing cost-effective flow sensors. Our experiment involves placing spheres in a wind tunnel and analyzing the corresponding flow data to observe the effect of large roughness elements on vortex-induced vibration and the drag coefficient drop off and recovery seen during the drag crisis at critical Reynolds numbers.
